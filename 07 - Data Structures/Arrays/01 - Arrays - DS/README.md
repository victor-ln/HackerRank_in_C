# Arrays - DS

An array is a type of data structure that stores elements of the same type in a contiguous block of memory. In an array, _`A`_, of size _`N`_, each memory location has some unique index, _`i`_ (where _`0 <= i <= N`_), that can be referenced as _`A[i]`_ or A<sub>i</sub>.

Reverse an array of integers.
