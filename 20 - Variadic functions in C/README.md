# Variadic functions in C

Variadic functions are functions which take a variable number of arguments. In C programming, a variadic function will contribute to the flexibility of the program that you are developing.

The declaration of a variadic function starts with the declaration of at least one named variable, and uses an ellipsis as the last parameter, e.g.
````
int printf(const char* format, ...);
````
In this problem, you will implement three variadic functions named `sum()`, `min()` and `max()` to calculate sums, minima, maxima of a variable number of arguments. The first argument passed to the variadic function is the count of the number of arguments, which is followed by the arguments themselves.

### Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer _`number_of_test_cases`_.
Each test case tests the logic of your code by sending a test implementation of 3, 5 and 10 elements respectively.
You can test your code against sample/custom input.
The error log prints the parameters which are passed to the test implementation. It also prints the sum, minimum element and maximum element corresponding to your code.

### Output Format

"Correct Answer" is printed corresponding to each correct execution of a test implementation."Wrong Answer" is printed otherwise.
